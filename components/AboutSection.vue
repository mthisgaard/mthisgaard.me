        Hi I'm Malene, a psychologist turned engineer based in Tokyo.
      </h3>

          With a background in psychology and a love for clean, user-friendly
          design, I make websites that are as engaging as they are functional.
          From the drawing board to deployment, I enjoy managing the entire life
          cycle of a project.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          I build great products by working iteratively with stakeholders and
          fellow engineers to identify the best approach, starting with a simple
          MVP, and continuously improving through trial and error. I thrive on
          tackling complex problems, learning from each try, and experimenting
          with new ideas along the way.
