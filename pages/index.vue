      <h1>Hi there, I'm Malene ðŸ‘‹</h1>
      <div>
        I'm a full stack engineer who likes to think outside the browser. With a
        background in psychology and a love for clean, user-friendly design, I
        make websites that are as engaging as they are functional. From the
        drawing board to deployment, I enjoy managing the entire life cycle of a
        project.
      </div>
      <div class="mt-2">
        I build great products by working iteratively with stakeholders and
        fellow engineers to identify the best approach, starting with a simple
        MVP, and continuously improving through trial and error. I thrive on
        tackling complex problems, learning from each try, and experimenting
        with new ideas along the way.
