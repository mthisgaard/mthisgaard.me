    <div>
      Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Malene, a Web Developer located in Tokyo. I relocated to
      Japan from Denmark to kickstart my career in Web Development and I am
      excited to combine my MSc in Psychology and background in behavioral
      design, and web editing with my full-stack coding skills, to create
      enjoyable and seamless user experiences. With experience in both front-
      and backend development, I aspire to be part of every step of the process,
      building projects from the ground up.
