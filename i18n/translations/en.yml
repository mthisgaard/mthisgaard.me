about:
  title: "Hi I'm Malene, a psychologist turned full stack developer."

  section2: "I build great products by working iteratively with stakeholders and fellow developers to identify the best approach, starting with a simple MVP, and continuously improving through trial and error. I thrive on tackling complex problems, learning from each try, and always experimenting with new ideas."
